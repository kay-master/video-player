# Web Skill Assessment

Welcome to the code challenge for Touchtribe. This repo is actually a small web application, a video player written in React, and your job is to implement some improvements and features.

There are several tasks listed below as **Required**, which are the baseline for completing a successful application. There are more tasks listed as **Extra**, which are either extra credit or which you may be asked by a hiring manager to complete.

Feel free to reach out to your point of contact at Touchtribe with any questions.

# General Setup and Submission Process

1) Fork this repo to your personal Gitlab account.

2) Clone the forked repo to your computer and install its dependences with npm.

3) Create a branch with your name (e.g.: *jane-doe*) in your fork.

4) Complete the **Required** tasks (see below).

5) Complete any **Extra** tasks that you can within the given time.

6) Make a PR against the master branch from your name branch. **Do not PR across forks. PR against your fork's master!**

7) Alert your recruiter that you've submitted a PR. They _may_ ask you to add collaborators.

# Required Coding Tasks

1) Implement these layouts for mobile and desktop. Use Styled Components for the CSS.

Mobile

Desktop

2) Right now the app shows 3 videos, but there are more in video-data.json. Load these videos as well and implement scrolling in the VideoList component.

3) Sort the videos so they display alphabetically by title.

4) This is not a design challenge, but use your best judgement to make the site look nice.

5) Make the selected video autoplay when a tile in the list is clicked.

# Senior Role Requirements
The following additional tasks are required if you are applying for a senior role.

1) Refactor the app to use Redux for managing global state. Make sure to enable Redux Dev Tools, too. 

2) Write tests using the tool of your choice.

# Extra Tasks (Complete any you can in the given time.)

1) Consider doing any of the senior role requirements, if you haven't already.

2) Implement lazy loading, loading 5 videos at a time on scroll down in VideoList.

3) Add deep linking support so that a user can link directly to a video and so that clicking on a thumbnail not only plays the video but also reflects the title in the browser url bar. Consider a library like React Router.

4) Convert the app to TypeScript.

5) Write your own Express server that serves the app.
